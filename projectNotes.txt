    Enemy Types: 
        Knight: Aggressive, Since he can’t move in straight line if you see him your
              fine. He will be shadowed so you can’t clearly see him. 
        Bishop: Moves in Diagonals so its hard to see him coming 
        Rook: Moves in straight lines, if you see him coming you are fucked 
            Its like the “maze” itself is attacking you 
        King: Following you slowly so its more of a coming threat. Acts as a timer so 
            the player has to finish the puzzles in a timely fashion.

    Contains a chessboard “app” so you can see the chess pieces coming.

    Knight Puzzle: 
        You are given a sword. 
        Attacking people with your sword is kinda pointless and causes your death

        You have to use the rooks movements to manipulate the piece into 
        completing the puzzle for you.
